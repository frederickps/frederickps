# Background
## Professional background
I have interened in numerous political institutions, such as the German Ministry for Defense and the German Embassy in the Dominican Republic, and worked as a research assistant the the Social Science Center (WZB) in Berlin as well as in a Public Affairs consultancy. Currently, I am seeking to venture into a position as a Data Scientist.

## Interests
🏀 I am a huge basketball fan. I played in the highest German youth divisions (JBBL, NBBL) before becoming a coach for an u14s team.

⚽ I also love footbal and am a proud but disillusioned member of Hertha BSC.

📕 As my studies suggest, I am highly interested in societal dynamics, specifically anything concerning the labor market.
